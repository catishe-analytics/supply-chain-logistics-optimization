# Supply Chain Logistics Optimization: Reducing Delivery Delays and Costs
End-to-end analysis of a global supply chain dataset (~180,000 orders) to identify key drivers of late deliveries, optimize shipping costs, and provide actionable business recommendations. This is my portfolio project as a Data Analyst, showcasing the skills I have gained in real projects.

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates core Data Analyst skills:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Statistical analysis and pattern identification
- Time series forecasting
- Interactive dashboard creation
- Business-oriented storytelling and recommendations

**Dataset**: [DataCo SMART SUPPLY CHAIN FOR BIG DATA ANALYSIS](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/dataco-smart-supply-chain-for-big-data-analysis) (Kaggle)  
Contains real-world-like e-commerce supply chain data including orders, shipping modes, delivery status, costs, customer segments, product categories, and geographic information.

## Key Questions Answered PLAN PLACEHOLDER
- What percentage of orders are delivered late, and what factors contribute most to delays?
- How do different shipping modes (Standard, Priority, First Class, Same Day) impact delivery performance and costs?
- Which product categories, markets, or regions have the highest late delivery risk and shipping costs?
- How can demand and delivery performance be forecasted to improve planning?
- What actionable changes could reduce delays and costs?

## Tools & Technologies PLAN PLACEHOLDER
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Prophet for forecasting)
- **SQL** (queries for data extraction and aggregation)
- **Power BI** / **Tableau Public** (interactive dashboard)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (full analysis workflow)
- **GitHub** (version control and documentation)
